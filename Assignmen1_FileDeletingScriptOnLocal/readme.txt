Assignment 1
============


Problem Statement : Make a script which deletes all the files at specific location say, /x/y/ which matches the a certain pattern like "*.txt" and which are "n" number of days old. The script will take input from a config file which will give input in a fixed pattern like

/usr/local/apache-tomcat/ "*.log" 5

Where (/usr/local/apache-tomcat/) is the location, ("*.log") is the pattern which the filename should match and (5) are number of days before which file was created.
